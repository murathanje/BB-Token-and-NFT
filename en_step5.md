* Now that our project is up and running, it's time to go to the `/get` address from the URL to send BB Tokens to our wallet.

* This way, we will be able to perform transactions on the platform.

* If you have reached the address `/get`, you need to connect your Metamask account first.

* In the input section, you should select and send the amount of BB tokens you want.

**REMINDER!! : Sending BB tokens to your account occurs in a real scenario when you complete the training. Currently, you can send a maximum of 99 BB tokens.** 

#### Once the BB tokens are in your wallet, you can return to the homepage.

* Now, you can choose a reward from the Reward Center and make a purchase with your BB tokens.
